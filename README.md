# How To Use
### Download and Import
* Download the most recent release from github
* Import the unity package from Unity via Assets -> Import Package -> Custom Package
    
### Use
* Add the CameraPositioner script to the camera you want to position
* Move the editor camera to the desired framing
* Press the button "Position Camera" on the CameraPositioner script of the camera you're moving
* You're done

### Note
The script CameraPositionerEditor must always remain in a folder named "Editor" in order for Unity to treat it as an editor script instead of a runtime script
